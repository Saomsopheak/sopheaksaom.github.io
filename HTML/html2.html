    <h2>About Jen’s Kitchen</h2>
    <p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. Bon Appetit! <br>
    The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews. <br><br>
    If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at <br> jen@example.com. <br><br>
